# Programming Fundamentals Project Using C++

This repository contains the first part of my projects for the **Programming Fundamentals** course at my university. In this project, I apply key programming concepts, including:

- Branching (conditional statements)
- Loops
- 1D and 2D arrays
- Strings
- Functions and function calls

## Compilation Instructions
